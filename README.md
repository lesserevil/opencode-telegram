```

### Smart Quality Management

If a video file is too large for Telegram (>50MB), ytBot automatically tries lower bitrates:
- Best available → 192kbps → 128kbps → 96kbps → 64kbps → 48kbps

This ensures you always get the audio, even if the original is too large.

**Supported YouTube URLs:**
- Standard videos: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`
- Short links: `https://youtu.be/...`
- YouTube Shorts: `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/...`
- **Playlists**: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...`
- **Videos with playlist context**: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...&list=...`

**Playlist Features:**
- ✅ Downloads up to **50 videos** per playlist (configurable)
- ✅ **Sequential downloading** to prevent rate limiting
- ✅ **Progress updates** for each video
- ✅ **Error resilience** - failed videos don't stop the playlist
- ✅ Summary statistics after completion

## Quick Installation

Choose the installation method that works best for you:

| Method | Best For | Command |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **npx** | Quick testing, temporary use | `npx @tommertom/ytbot@latest` |
| **Global Install** | Regular use, permanent installation | `npm install -g @tommertom/ytbot` |
| **Docker** | Isolation, Windows, production | `npx @tommertom/ytbot@latest --docker` |

### Method 1: Run with npx (Easiest - No Installation)

Perfect for trying out ytBot or if you don't want to install anything permanently:

```bash
npx @tommertom/ytbot@latest
```

**First Run:** The bot will create a `.env` file automatically and exit with instructions:

```
⚠️  No .env file found in current directory!

📝 Creating .env template...

✅ Created .env file from template

🔧 Please edit .env and configure:
   - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS (required)
   - ALLOWED_USER_IDS (required)

Then run the command again.
```

**Edit the configuration:**

```bash
# Open the .env file that was created
nano .env
```

**Run again to start the bot:**

```bash
npx @tommertom/ytbot@latest
```

### Method 2: Install Globally

Install once and run anytime:

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @tommertom/ytbot

# Run (creates .env on first run)
ytbot
```

**First Run:** Same as npx - creates `.env` file automatically:
1. Bot creates `.env` file and exits
2. You edit `.env` with your tokens
3. Run `ytbot` again to start

## 🚩 CLI Flags

ytBot supports command-line flags to modify its behavior:

### `--docker` Flag

**Purpose:** Generates Docker configuration files in your current directory.

**Usage:**
```bash
npx @tommertom/ytbot@latest --docker
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates a production-ready `Dockerfile` in your current directory
2. Creates a `docker-compose.yml` configured for ytBot
3. Prompts you before overwriting any existing files
4. Exits after file generation (does not start the bot)

**Example output:**
```
🤖 ytBOT - AI-Powered Telegram Terminal Bot
================================================

🐳 Docker Setup Mode

✅ Created Dockerfile at /your/project/Dockerfile
✅ Created docker-compose.yml at /your/project/docker-compose.yml

✅ Docker setup complete!

📝 Next steps:
   1. Create a .env file with your configuration
   2. Run: docker-compose up -d
   3. View logs: docker-compose logs -f
```

**If files already exist:**
```
⚠️  Dockerfile already exists. Overwrite? (y/N): n
❌ Skipping Dockerfile creation.
⚠️  docker-compose.yml already exists. Overwrite? (y/N): yes
✅ Created docker-compose.yml at /your/project/docker-compose.yml
```

**When to use:**
- Setting up ytBot with Docker for the first time
- Updating Docker configurations to latest recommended settings
- Getting production-ready Docker files without manual copying

**Note:** You can respond with `y`, `yes`, `n`, or `no` (case-insensitive) to the overwrite prompts.

### Method 3: Docker (Most Isolated)

Run in a container with all dependencies included. Docker is perfect for:
- **Isolation**: Keeps ytBot separate from your system
- **Consistency**: Same environment on any machine
- **Easy Updates**: Pull latest version with one command
- **Windows Users**: Best option for Windows compatibility

#### Option A: Quick Setup with --docker flag (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with Docker:

**Step 1: Generate Docker files**
```bash
# Creates Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in current directory
npx @tommertom/ytbot@latest --docker
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Production-tested `Dockerfile` is created
- ✅ Pre-configured `docker-compose.yml` is created  
- ✅ You're prompted before overwriting existing files
- ✅ Clear next steps are displayed

**Step 2: Create your configuration**

Create a `.env` file (see Configuration section below) or use the quick method:

```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS=your_bot_token_here
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=your_telegram_user_id
ADMIN_USER_ID=your_telegram_user_id
MESSAGE_DELETE_TIMEOUT=10000
EOF
```

**Step 3: Start the bot**
```bash
docker-compose up -d      # Start in background
docker-compose logs -f    # View logs (Ctrl+C to exit)
```

**That's it!** Your bot is now running in Docker.

**Managing your Docker bot:**
```bash
docker-compose stop       # Stop the bot
docker-compose start      # Start the bot
docker-compose restart    # Restart the bot
docker-compose down       # Stop and remove container
docker-compose logs -f    # View live logs
```

#### Option B: Manual Docker Setup

**Create `.env` file:**

```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS=your_bot_token_here
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=your_telegram_user_id
ADMIN_USER_ID=your_telegram_user_id
MESSAGE_DELETE_TIMEOUT=10000
EOF
```

## Configuration

ytBot needs a few settings to work. These are stored in a `.env` file that's **created automatically on first run**.

### Automatic .env Creation

When you run ytBot for the first time:

1. **Bot detects no .env file** and creates one from the template
2. **Bot exits** with a message telling you to edit it
3. **You edit .env** with your bot token and user ID
4. **You run the bot again** - it starts normally

### Required Settings

The `.env` file contains these settings:

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Your Telegram bot token from @BotFather
# Get one by messaging @BotFather on Telegram and creating a new bot
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS=1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz

# Your Telegram user ID (the bot will tell you this when you first message it)
# Only users in this list can use the bot
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789

# Admin user ID - receives notifications about unauthorized access
ADMIN_USER_ID=123456789

# How long confirmation messages stay visible (in milliseconds)
# 10000 = 10 seconds, set to 0 to keep messages
MESSAGE_DELETE_TIMEOUT=10000
```

### Finding Your Telegram User ID

1. Start the bot (even before configuring ALLOWED_USER_IDS)
2. Send any message to your bot
3. The bot will reply with your User ID
4. Add that ID to `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` in `.env`
5. Restart the bot

### Multiple Users

You can allow multiple people to use your bot:

```bash
# Separate multiple user IDs with commas (no spaces)
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789,987654321,555666777
```

### Multiple Bots

Run multiple bot instances with different tokens:

```bash
# Separate tokens with commas (no spaces)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS=token1,token2,token3
```

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux or macOS (Windows not supported)
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Python 3**: For yt-dlp (YouTube downloader)
- **Disk Space**: ~500MB for dependencies

## Installing Dependencies

ytBot requires `yt-dlp` to download YouTube videos:

```bash
# macOS
brew install yt-dlp

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp

# Or using pip (any OS with Python)
pip3 install yt-dlp

# Verify installation
yt-dlp --version
```

**Note:** Docker installation includes all dependencies automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### First Run - .env File

**Issue**: Bot creates .env and exits immediately

**This is normal!** On first run:
1. Bot creates `.env` file automatically
2. Bot shows you what to configure
3. Bot exits so you can edit the file
4. Edit `.env` with your bot token and user ID
5. Run the bot again

### Bot Not Responding

1. Check the bot is running (check console output or Docker logs)
2. Verify your User ID is in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`
3. Make sure `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS` is correct
4. Restart the bot

### Downloads Failing

1. Verify yt-dlp is installed: `yt-dlp --version`
2. Check the YouTube URL is valid
3. Try downloading manually to see error: `yt-dlp <URL>`
4. Update yt-dlp: `pip3 install --upgrade yt-dlp`
5. Check you have enough disk space

### File Not Received

1. Check bot console/logs for errors
2. Verify file was downloaded (check download directory)
3. File might be too large even at lowest quality
4. Try a shorter/smaller video

## FAQ

**Q: The bot exits immediately after I run it. What's wrong?**  
A: Nothing! On first run, the bot creates a `.env` file and exits so you can configure it. Edit the `.env` file with your bot token and user ID, then run the bot again.

**Q: Where does the bot run?**  
A: On YOUR machine - anywhere you want! Your laptop, home server, Raspberry Pi, or cloud VPS. You have complete control.

**Q: Do I need to trust a third-party service?**  
A: No! The bot runs on your own machine. No data goes to external services except YouTube (for downloading) and Telegram (for messaging).

**Q: Can I download playlists?**  
A: Currently ytBot handles individual videos. Send one URL at a time.

**Q: What video formats are supported?**  
A: ytBot downloads whatever yt-dlp supports - essentially all YouTube videos.

**Q: How long are files kept?**  
A: Files are sent immediately and can be configured to clean up automatically.

**Q: Can multiple people use the same bot?**  
A: Yes! Add multiple user IDs to `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`.

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: This is for personal use only. Ensure you have the right to download any content. See the Legal Notice above.

**Q: Can I run this on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Yes, as long as it runs Node.js 18+ and has enough storage.

**Q: What happens if my machine goes offline?**  
A: The bot stops working until you bring it back online. That's the trade-off for self-hosting and complete control.
